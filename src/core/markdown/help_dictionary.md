  * *Node* - basic building block that can be connected with each other
  * *Variable Node* - used for storing arbitrary value
  * *Operation Node* - used for performing basic operation on values such as:
    * addition
    * subtraction
    * multiplication
    * division
  * *Cast Node* - used for converting one data type to another
  * *Comparison Node* - used for comparing values using:
    * equal (==)
    * not equal (!=)
    * less than (<)
    * greater than (>)
    * less than or equals to (<=)
