Following the previous tutorial (*Navigation*), do the following:
  1. *create* a *variable node* with the following properties:
    * Name - first_addend
    * Slot Type - INTEGER
    * Value - 32
    * Description/Comment - this is the first variable
  2. *create* another *variable node* with the following properties:
    * Name - second_addend
    * Slot Type - INTEGER
    * Value - 64
    * Description/Comment - this is the second variable
  3. *create* another *variable node* with the following properties:
    * Name - sum
    * Slot Type - INTEGER
    * Value - 0
    * Description/Comment - this node will store the sum
  4. *position* them nicely such as:
    * *first_addend* is above the *second_addend*
    * *second_addend* is below the *first_addend*
    * *sum* is on the right of the two other nodes (put a medium space between them)
