Following the previous tutorial (*Create Node Variables*), do the following:
  1. Create a *Operation* node (under the *Basic Node*) and place between the addends and the sum nodes
  2. Select *ADD* as *operation*
  3. Select *INTEGER* as *slot type*
  4. Click *create* to finish creating the operation node
  5. Connect the *output slot* of *first_addend* to the *input slot* of *operation node*
  6. Connect the *output slot* of *second_addend* to the *input slot* of *operation node*
  7. Connect the *output slot* of *operation node* to the *input slot* of *sum*
  8. You will see that the *value* of *sum* becomes *96* (64 + 32)
